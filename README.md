# conferences
This repository contains list of some selected 2020 conferences in deep learning, computer vision and possibly biomedical imaging with deadlines for the standard paper submission. The list was created 10th October 2019 and if there were not published deadlines I did estimate them from year 2019. Good source is here: http://www.guide2research.com/topconf/computer-vision
